# An Analysis of Election Data Using Python
## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to calculate election results from an excel spreadsheet that contains raw election data for a precinct, including the ballot ID, the county where each vote was cast, and the candidate each ballot was cast for.

A python script was made which calculated the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

The number and percentages of votes cast from each county and a calcuation of the largest county turnout was also reported.

This was in turn printed out to a text file with a readout of results.
